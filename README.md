# Event Fraud Detection Case Study

A machine learning application to predict fraud events on realtime data streams. Compared the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest and GradientBoasting Classifier Algorithms by fine tuning the model to have the highest score accuracy. Developed a web app using Flask, Jinja and CSS to predict the risk level of live data with a recall score of 96% and precision of 85%.

Due to confidentiality, the training data is not made public. The python code is made available in the src file. The model is also available as a pickle file.
